Banking Operations Dashboard using Power BI

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of banking operations through a dynamic Power BI dashboard. It offers insights into customer demographics, transaction trends, account balances, and branch performance. The interactive visuals help stakeholders make informed decisions based on real-time banking metrics.

2. Short Description / Purpose
   
This Power BI dashboard visualizes key banking metrics such as total customers, accounts, transactions, and balances. It aims to support data-driven decision-making by providing a clear, interactive overview of operational performance across branches and states.

3. Tech Stack
   
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Data Source
   
Source: Sample banking datasets (internally generated for dashboard development and analysis practice).Includes over 500 records across five tables: Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Branches, and Employees. The data simulates real-world banking scenarios and is structured using a relational model with a star schema for efficient analysis in Power BI.
